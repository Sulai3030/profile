    text: "Beer Near Here is a project to successfully connect discerning beer drinkers in Manhattan with bars in the city that serve the beers that they like. We start with a brief survey that takes in their preferences and matches those answers with the <a href='https://untappd.com/'>Untappd database.</a> Using this API we can populate a map using the Google Maps API that then lists the locations of bars and taverns that carry the user's beer preference.",
