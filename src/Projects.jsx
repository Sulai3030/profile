            Beer Near Here is a project to successfully connect discerning beer drinkers in Manhattan with bars in the city that serve the beers that they like. We start with a brief survey that takes in their preferences and matches those answers with the
            <a href="https://untappd.com/">Untappd database.</a> Using this API we can populate a map using the Google Maps API that then lists the locations of bars and taverns that carry the user's beer preference.

            My second group project was the GOAT Voter App. G.O.A.T. Voter is a project created with the intention to get the youth vote informed and participating. Focusing on a mobile platform, our team pulled in info using various APIs to gather helpful voter information such as polling location, voting dates, candidate info, and ballot questions into one place. Now, the average US voter can easily enter their zipcode and find their nearest polling location and its hours. Using various APIs and incumbent webpage info, we were able to bulild an app that aids voters in participating in their civic duty.

            The Firebase Assignment is a culmination of the first half of our learning utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Firebase. Also know as the Train Scheduuler assignment we were tasked with using Google's Firebase platform. Firebase allows you to store and sync data across all clients in realtime, and remains available when your app goes offline. The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client.

                The LIRI Bot excercise is an assignment where we employed LIRI or Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in paramares and returns data. In this case it takes in parameters from both the Twitter and Spotify apps and interpolates that data and returns data to the user.

            Our goal for this assignment was to create a webpage and dynamically populate a grid with gifs when the user input a search parameter. Using an array as well as jQuery and event handlers I was able to allow a user via an Ajax call to populate the page with appropriate gifs by stipulatinig the rating in the if statement.
